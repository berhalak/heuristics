# Slower is Faster

## Question
I want to move to the next topic. Why is the group not getting along?

## Heuristic
Slower is faster.

## Examples
- During a visual collaboration meeting, we should wait for the participants to catch-up
- During a mob programming session, the mob should be on the same page
- In general, going slower in collaborative sessions, help the group to absorb the information
