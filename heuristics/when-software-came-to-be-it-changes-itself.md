# When software came to be, it changes itself

## Question
Why do I spend time in software maintenance?

## Heuristic
When software came to be, it changes itself.

## Examples
- What if we have a new feature?
- When someone uses the software, they want a new feature
- Unpredicatable behaviour from users, will change the perception of the software
